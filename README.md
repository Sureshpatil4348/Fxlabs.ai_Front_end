## üîß Configuration

### WebSocket Connection

The frontend connects to the MT5 server at:
```javascript
const WEBSOCKET_URL = 'ws://localhost:8000/ws/market';
```

To change the server URL, edit `src/store/useMarketStore.js`:

```javascript
const WEBSOCKET_URL = 'ws://your-server:8000/ws/market';
```

### 5. Activity Logs

- Real-time connection and data logs
- Color-coded message types:
  - üü¢ Success (connections, subscriptions)
  - üî¥ Errors (connection failures, invalid symbols)
  - üü° Warnings (disconnections, unsubscriptions)
  - üîµ Info (data updates, general messages)

## üì± Responsive Design

The dashboard is fully responsive and works on:

- **Desktop** (1200px+) - Full layout with sidebar
- **Tablet** (768px-1199px) - Stacked layout
- **Mobile** (320px-767px) - Single column layout

### Dynamic Grid Layout

The RSI Correlation Dashboard features a dynamic grid system that automatically adjusts the number of columns based on available screen width:

- **Small (sm)**: 3 columns (640px+)
- **Medium (md)**: 4 columns (768px+)
- **Large (lg)**: 5 columns (1024px+)
- **Extra Large (xl)**: 6 columns (1280px+)
- **2X Large (2xl)**: 8 columns (1536px+)
- **3X Large (3xl)**: 10 columns (1920px+)

This ensures maximum information density without requiring horizontal scrolling, displaying more correlation pairs as screen space allows.

## üé® UI Components

### Connection Panel
- WebSocket connection status
- Server information
- Connection controls

### Subscription Panel
- Symbol input and timeframe selection
- Data type checkboxes
- Active subscription list

### Market Data Panel
- Tabbed interface for different data views
- Symbol selector for multiple subscriptions
- Real-time data updates

### Logs Panel
- Activity log with timestamps
- Message type filtering
- Log statistics

### Watchlist
- Displays Pair, RSI, Price, and Daily % for watchlisted symbols
- Updates live using data from the RSI Tracker (no manual refresh needed)
- Add items by clicking a pair row in the RSI Tracker; remove from the Watchlist panel
- Daily % is color-coded (green for positive, red for negative)

### AI News Analysis
- Displays AI-powered forex news insights with impact badges and analysis.
- Timestamps are shown in the device's local timezone (local date and time), timezone name is not displayed.
- Tabs available: Upcoming, Released, All News (in that order). Default tab is Upcoming.
 - Feed is restricted to High-impact news across all tabs.
- Ordering is handled in the frontend (`src/components/AINewsAnalysis.js`):
  - Upcoming items (where `actual` is `N/A` or `null`) appear first.
  - Then by impact (high, then medium, then low) when applicable within each set. Currently, only high-impact items are visible.
  - No chronological sorting beyond upcoming-first is currently applied.
- If the API is unavailable, a banner will display: "API unavailable. Showing cached or no data."
 - Each news card is clickable to open details. Hover shows a pointer cursor.
 - News card border color reflects Expected Effect:
   - Bullish: green border (`border-success-600`)
   - Bearish: red border (`border-danger-600`)
   - Neutral: default border (or yellow border if upcoming event)

## üîÑ State Management

Using Zustand for efficient state management:

```javascript
// Connection state
isConnected, isConnecting, connectionError

// Market data
subscriptions, tickData, ohlcData

// UI state
selectedSymbol, selectedTimeframe, dataTypes

// Actions
connect(), disconnect(), subscribe(), unsubscribe()
```

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

- **Efficient Updates**: Tick data updates every 100ms, OHLC every 1-2 seconds
- **Data Limiting**: Keep last 50 ticks and 100 OHLC bars per symbol
- **Selective Rendering**: Only update components when relevant data changes
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old data and subscriptions

2. Add message handlers for new data types
3. Create UI components to display the data

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem:** "Connection refused"
```
Solution: Ensure MT5 server is running on localhost:8000
Check: python server.py in the backend directory
```

**Problem:** "WebSocket connection failed"
```
Solution: Check firewall settings and server logs
Verify: Backend server is accessible
```

### Data Issues

**Problem:** "No tick data received"
```
Solution: Check MT5 terminal is connected and symbol exists
Verify: Symbol is available in MT5 Market Watch
```

**Problem:** "OHLC data not updating"
```
Solution: Ensure timeframe is supported and market is open
Check: Server logs for OHLC processing errors
```

### UI Issues

**Problem:** "Charts not rendering"
```
Solution: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
Verify: All dependencies are installed correctly
```

## CI/CD (Netlify via GitHub Actions)

- **DEV (Preview)**: On pull requests targeting `asoasis/development`, auto-deploys to `NETLIFY_SITE_ID_DEV` with `netlify deploy --prod` using the `build` directory.
- **QA**: On pushes/merges to `asoasis/development`, auto-deploys to `NETLIFY_SITE_ID_QA` using the `build` directory.
- **Production**: On pushes/merges to `main`, auto-deploys to `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` using the `build` directory.

Required repository secrets:
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` (production)
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID_QA` (qa)
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID_DEV` (dev)

Workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy-to-netlify.yml`.

### Linting in CI

The CI workflow runs `npm run lint` before building and treats warnings as errors (`CI=true`). Ensure lint passes locally:

```bash
npm ci
npm run lint
```

To auto-fix formatting and some warnings locally:

```bash
npm run lint -- --fix
```

Notes:
- Accessibility rules are enabled. Clickable, non-interactive elements should be keyboard accessible (role, tabIndex, and key handlers) or changed to native interactive elements where appropriate.
- Labels should be associated to inputs with matching `htmlFor` and `id`.
- Escape quotes in JSX text (e.g., use `&apos;` or `&quot;`).
 - Unused variables/params should be removed or prefixed with `_` to comply with `.eslintrc.json` (`argsIgnorePattern`/`varsIgnorePattern`).
 - `console` statements are restricted; only `console.warn` and `console.error` are allowed per `.eslintrc.json`.
 - Build in CI sets `process.env.CI=true`; run locally with `CI=true npm run build` to replicate.

ESLint is configured via `.eslintrc.json` and ignores common build directories via `.eslintignore`.

## üîß Recent Bug Fixes

### Watchlist Service Fixes (September 2025)

**Issues Fixed:**
- **Delete functionality not working**: Fixed missing `syncWatchlist` method in `watchlistService.js`
- **Duplicate values issue**: Fixed inconsistent symbol normalization causing duplicate entries like "GBPCADM -- -- --"
- **Display showing dashes**: Fixed watchlist items showing "-- -- --" instead of actual market data
- **Symbol format mismatch**: Fixed critical issue where watchlist symbols (CHFJPY) didn't match RSI Tracker format (CHFJPYm)
- **Inconsistent symbol storage**: Fixed mixed symbol formats causing lookup failures and subscription issues

**Changes Made:**
1. **Symbol Normalization**: Added consistent uppercase normalization in `addToWatchlist` method
2. **Missing Method**: Implemented `syncWatchlist` method for proper database synchronization
3. **Data Consistency**: Ensured all watchlist operations use normalized symbols to prevent duplicates
4. **Auto-Subscription**: Added automatic market data subscription when symbols are added to watchlist
5. **Load-Time Subscription**: Auto-subscribe to existing watchlist symbols when loading watchlist
6. **Pending Subscriptions**: Implemented pending subscription queue for symbols added before connection
7. **Connection Management**: Auto-connect RSI Tracker when watchlist symbols need subscription
8. **Symbol Format Conversion**: Added automatic 'm' suffix conversion for RSI Tracker compatibility
9. **Consistent Symbol Storage**: Standardized watchlist to store base symbols (CADJPY) without 'M' suffix
10. **Proper Data Lookup**: Fixed WishlistPanel to convert base symbols to RSI format for data retrieval
11. **Clean Implementation**: Removed debug logs and implemented clean, production-ready solution

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/watchlistService.js`: Added symbol normalization and `syncWatchlist` method
